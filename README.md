# 📊 Personal Finance Analysis | SQL + Power BI Project

> **"Before analyzing corporate finances, we should understand our own."**

---

## 🧠 Project Overview

This project combines **SQL and Power BI** to perform an end‑to‑end analysis of personal financial data.

The goal is to demonstrate how data analytics can be applied not only to business environments but also to our daily financial decisions — helping us understand income behavior, spending patterns, and savings opportunities.

It also reflects my belief that professional growth and personal growth go hand in hand.
